# stat259_lab3_clone
practice lab3 for stat259

Plan for lab3:

Creating your own GitHub repos. You’ve cloned repos that someone else has already created.
Simulating a GitHub Collaboration Pair. Last week, we simulated two colleagues working on the same git repository with the use of local branches. Today, we will split up into pairs and you will get practice pushing to the same repo and attempting to resolve any merge conflicts as they arise.
Reconstructing past versions. Let’s say you want to back to previous versions of a repository (marked by previous commits), or that you want to recover deleted files? We’ll go through that today.
Forks and Pull Requests (if time). Let’s say we have a collaboration where you don’t have write access to a repository but you would like to suggest changes. We will go over how to fork repositories, make our edits, and suggest they be merged into the main repo with a pull request.
